%4.2.3.2.4 Collision detection and enforcement (half duplex mode only)
% page 136

%In full duplex mode, there is never contention for a shared physical medium. The Physical Layer may
%indicate to the MAC that there are simultaneous transmissions by both stations, but since these transmissions
%do not interfere with each other, a MAC operating in full duplex mode must not react to such Physical Layer
%indications. Full duplex stations do not defer to received traffic, nor abort transmission, jam, backoff, and
%reschedule transmissions as part of Transmit Media Access Management. Transmissions may be initiated
%whenever the station has a packet queued, subject only to the interpacket gap required to allow recovery for
%other sublayers and for the physical medium

In half duplex mode, a collision occurs when two stations try to transmit packets simultaneously. When a collision is detected, instead of terminating the transmission immediately, transmitter continues to send a set of additional bits called as \textit{collision enforcement bits} or \textit{jam bits} of length{\tt jamSize}. This ensures that the collision is detected by all the transmitting stations on the network. When a transmission attempt has been terminated due to a collision, transmitter retries until either it is successful or a maximum number of attempts({\tt attemptLimit = 16}) have been made and all have terminated due to collisions.\\ 

These retransmissions are scheduled by a randomization process called \textit{truncated binary exponential backoff}. The delay, before attempting a retransmission is an integer multiple of time taken to emits 512 bits, called as slot time({\tt slotTime}). The number of slot times to delay before the $n^{th}$ retransmission attempt is chosen as a uniformly distributed random integer $r$ in the range $0\leq r < 2^k$ where $k = min(n, 10)$. After 16 re-tries({\tt attemptLimit}) this event is reported as an error to the higher layers and interface gives-up the transmission.\\

{\small Note: In the below diagram Transmission is abbreviated as TX; ``Deferring On?'' decision block delays the packet for Inter Frame Gap(IFG) once MAC identifies the channel is idle and available for a transmission.}
